# Gensolve Practice Manager

If you love helping people go for their dreams. We love helping people like you.

Treating a dysfunctional business is much like treating a dysfunctional body. Both have subjective and objective perspectives on the problem. The key to success is to review what is going wrong with complete honesty.

The path to growth starts more painful than is helpful. While you need to take a step back before you can make significant breakthroughs. But with consistent commitment, you will gain more than you can currently imagine. At the end of our journey, it is not the money in the bank that counts but the depth and number of close connections made.

## Save Money

Before you focus on growth, you need to eliminate all the waste in your business operations. Don't take our word for it, we have created a free performance analysis spreadsheet you can use to judge the financial health of your practice.

## Quality

Our Patient Records allow you to **deliver and measure the effectiveness of your plan of care** with all a patient information efficiently recorded and stored in one place.

GPM has [extensive clinical notes out of the box](/docs/features/practice-manager/client-records/), where **each clinician** can completely customise their optimum treatment pathway.

- Treatment and Analysis plans
- Customisable Text Shortcuts
- General Health and Patient History
- Document and Video uploads
- Referrals, Investigations, and Discharges
- Full Medical History Reports

## Finances

Track cashflow through to your balance sheet with your accountant without leaving the application. Strong financial controls are fundamental to the success of any business. With Gensolve your Accountant can directly implement real-time value by guiding how to configure your ledgers for better analysis of results versus your growth strategy. [Invite your accountant](/docs/roles/accountant) to take look. If your accountant already uses [Xero](https://www.xero.com/) no problems, Gensolve has [integration](/docs/features/integrations/) covered.

## Productivity

Manage your clinicians and your administration team. Schedule recurring activities to save effort

- Multi-site configuration: Configure Clinicians to work across multiple sites, maintaining a single consolidated view for each Clinician’s availability.
- Task manager: Using the in-built Task Manager, practices can easily assign tasks and actions to the appointment book or clinical notes, saving on time and creating more efficient patient follow up
- Waiting room: Track a patient from the time they arrive in the practice until they leave and share this information in real-time across your practice.
- Cancellation and no-show management: Monitor no-shows and cancellations and link the information to patients’ files.
- SMS reminders: Send SMS Reminders of appointments in bulk to clients.

## Marketing

Since marketing and sales will generate revenue, you need to understand your target customers and determine how you will reach them. Most practices use an "**inside-out** approach to marketing in that they list their services based on skills and then look to sell to a vaguely defined group that is **out there**

The **build it and they will come** approach usually results in wasted effort and failure. Assess the needs of your intended client's bearing in mind that upwards of 80% of them are likely to come from within a 10km radius.

## Customise

Just like Frank you can leave your regrets behind and take complete control of your patient experience and run your business exactly how you want. With full support for multi-disciplinary clinics, GPM enables customisation that enable:

Clinical Directors to:

- plan the optimum journey to follow for quality control of treatment plans
- capture objective, subjective, specific injury or rehabilitation type analysis

Operations Managers to capture:

- Patient (GDPR) Consent
- Measure Staff Engagement

Marketing Managers to capture:

- Net Promoter Scores and Testimonial Surveys
- Friends and Family referrals

Financial Managers to budget operating margin with contract charges for established plans of care.

## Control

If you cannot measure it, you cannot improve it, if your processes are inconsistent, what you measure is boll... not much use.

Track performance, connect the dots, close the loop, review your strategy and adjust your plans to take control of your destiny.

**We take security seriously!** With Gensolve you can lock down access to certain computers or even the time of day when access is allowed. So even if your computer is lost or stolen you can terminate access immediately and if you are following Gensolve's best practices [no files should be on your hard drive](/docs/growth/compliance/file-management).

## Expand

Smart business operators leverage Gensolve's ability to deliver economies of scale from a central business administration hub to grow nationwide business operations. Combine that with our second to none data migration support and you have a very rare combination to rapidly scale while maintaining control of key processes.

In fact, Gensolve has facilitated over 30 practice mergers in the past two years. Compared to the headaches accepted with most mergers the beautiful thing with a _G2G migration_ is that from one day to the next your operations remain the same, leaving your team free to focus on customer service not boring administration tasks.
