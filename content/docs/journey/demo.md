## Sign In

To start your journey of understanding what GPM offers you can log into either the Native or Web applications with the following credentials.

| Field        | Setting       |
| ------------ | ------------- |
| Organisation | Demo Practice |
| Username     | CN            |
| Password     | Dem0User      |

::: tip Focus brings increased productivity
You can hide functionality you don't need to help with navigating to what you need to do.
:::

CN represents a Clinician and what you see when logged into GPM is the core functionality that Clinician needs to do their job. In an efficient and profitable business, over 80% of the work should client-facing and can be achieved by interacting with this restricted interface.

By way of contrast, sign in as the **SUPER** user name with the same password to see all possible functionality.

::: tip You can log in more than once!
Hold down the shift key then click on the GPM icon to open another application in parallel. Sign in using **SUPER** as the username.
