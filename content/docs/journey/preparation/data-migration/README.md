title: Data Transfer

# Data Transfer

## Extract Transform and Load

**Extract** - your current supplier exports data and makes it available to you or a secure place we can access it.

**Transform** - data from your old system is transformed into a format that can be used in GPM.

**Load** - transformed data is loaded into GPM. Depending on the size of your business this can take 30 mins to an entire weekend. Most migrations take approximately 2 hours to complete.

## Timeline

This is the process of getting your current supplier to extract your data, transfer that over to us so we can run the migration logic to set-up your organisation.

Below is a baseline critical path, but date and times vary dependent on workloads to respective parties and the complexity of the system you are coming from. **Note - we cannot confirm a GO LIVE date until your team confirms the migration logic is correct**. The items in bold below are your responsibility of your team.

## Other PMS

If your current Practice Management System is not in the list, creating new data transfer logic requires significant analysis and testing time, to justify the cost of development we first need to judge how much of the market a competitor's solution has which we will take into account when evaluating migration charges.

When dealing with data from a system we have not seen before **we are reliant on your team to guide us** as we are working blind and don't know your data as you do. If your team dutifully runs the migration approval checklist will provide then the logic should be confirmed ready for running the **Go Live** migration within two iterations.

## Signing off Logic Approval

We cannot know your data as well as you do. The Approval environment is created purely for your benefit to test the migration logic and know exactly what to expect when you go live.
