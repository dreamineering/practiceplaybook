# Migrate to Gensolve from a new system

Creating new data tranfer logic is a complex and time consuming task, for our business case to justify the cost of development we first need to judge how much of the market a competitor's solution has. We will take this into account when evaluating migration charges.

Below is indicator of the critical path, dependent of workloads to respective parties. **Note - we cannot confirm a GO LIVE date until your team confirms the migration logic is correct**. The items in bold below are your responsibility of your team.

1. Request Approval Data Dump
2. Data dump received
3. Initial migration logic run (+7-14 Days)
4. **Run through Approval Checklist (+7-14 Days)**
5. **Approval Problems Feedback**
6. Run approval migration with fixes
7. Repeat steps 3-5 until no issue
8. **Signoff migration logic**
9. Confirm Go Live date
10. **Confirm final transfer date with your existing solution provider**

If you wish to transfer data from a system whose data we have not seen before **you must commit to helping us check the logic as nobody knows your data like you do**. If your team dutifully runs the migration approval checklist will provide then the logic should be confirmed ready for running the **Go Live** migration within two iterations.

Please make a request to the support team to dump the data of all tables into CSV files. Alternatively you can send a link to this page and the database adminstrator can choose to save time and bandwidth by dumping what they consider will be the required data.
