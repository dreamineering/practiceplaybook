# System Configuration

Depending on the size and services your practice offers we have some spreadsheets we can review together that will significantly speed up and improve tailoring the system to your specific needs when your practice begins using Gensolve to run operations.

### Optional

You can set this up in the system but it is faster to initially load some settings compared to entering each record in the user interface

## System Administrator Checklist

Your system will be loaded with a checklist of admin settings you need to confirm as OK for your operations before take off.

Some of these tasks are vital to be ready to fully operations on **Go Live** day, others are simply so your practice manager has a basic knowledge of what is possible and know where to look for help when the time is right to make further customisations. This list will be reviewed with a Gensolve onboarding expert, before and after completion to clear up any questions.
