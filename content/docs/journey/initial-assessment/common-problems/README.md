## Do you have a cash flow forecast?

If a business runs out of cash and is not able to obtain new finance, and will have to close. It is no excuse for management to claim that they didn't see a cash flow crisis coming.

Cash flow is the **life-blood of all businesses** – particularly start-ups and small enterprises. As a result, it is essential to maintain a forecast (predict) what is going to happen to cash flow to make sure the business has enough to survive.

Here are the key reasons why a cash flow forecast is so important:

- Provides an **early warning system**. This is the most important reason for a cash flow forecast
- Makes sure that the business can afford to pay suppliers and employees. Suppliers who don't get paid will soon stop supplying the business; it is even worse if employees are not paid on time
- Spot problems with customer payments – preparing the forecast encourages the business to look at how quickly customers are paying their debts.
- External stakeholders such banks will want to look at cash flow forecasts at regular intervals
- It enforces thinking about the business in a broader picture when making strategic decisions
