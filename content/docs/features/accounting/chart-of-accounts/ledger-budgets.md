# Chart of Accounts > Ledger Budgets

[Managing Ledger Budgets](http://docs.gensolve.com/help/gpm_nz/desktop/Processes/Accounting/Managing_Ledger_Budgets.htm) is made easier by editing in excel so you can upload (via migration tool) a worst-case and a best-case scenario where numbers can be updated as you edit the excel file.

This activity will help you to customise your ledger configuration to get the granularity of reporting that will help understand the success of your strategy.
