# Hold better meetings

Before blocking out and sending an invite, be absolutely clear on the desired outcome.

- Maximum duration is 30 minutes
- Meetings are for making decisions
  1. What decisions need to be made?
  2. Who can make these decisions?
  3. What obstacles to overcome?
  4. Who can do what by when?
- Don't invite people to attend that cannot make decisions.

## Using Gensolve

1. Dedicate time in the diary with Provider Appointment of the appropriate type based on core business area for example Productivity for general planning.
2. Use the notes section to state attendees and desired outcome of the meeting, see example below
3. Use Front Office > Events Due to systematically go through Agenda Items
4. Don't overrun the meeting. Break up and come back to finish
