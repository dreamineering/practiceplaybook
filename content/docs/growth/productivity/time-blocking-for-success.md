# Time Blocking for Success - WIP

Elite performers, without exception, [value their time extremely high](https://nav.al/hourly-rate) and guard their time ferociously so they can [extract maximum value from their efforts](https://fourminutebooks.com/tools-of-titans-summary/). If you are a leader in your organisation, the single most important skill you need to master to have a positive impact on your business is time management.

Crucially, you must be vigilant to [eliminate reactive firefighting work](https://www.paulgough.com/podcast/ep-283/), this includes answering phone calls or emails where you have not set the agenda and schedule time for [Deep Work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTaJhjQHcf8&t=7s) where you are completely [indistractable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kESwCrwOGtg).

## Why use Gensolve for business planning?

Why use Gensolve for planning how to spend you administer your business? Because you have the ability to improve your plans by analysisg historical data to see how productive you have been. If you have weaknesses you can raise these with a business specialist in the area of concern. The ability to move or copy appointments also makes planning or adjusting a plan extremely easy.

The greatest benefit of all you will learn the art of effective delegation, as once you have set up strong patterns, you can pass these on to your staff and know how to interpret results and what performance benchmarks to expect.

Timing the right activity for the right time [is a science](https://zapier.com/blog/daily-schedules-for-productivity/), do yourself a massive favour and [learn how to make the most of your time](https://blog.rescuetime.com/when-to-work-productivity-curves/)!

While a standard to-do list tells you what you need to do, time blocking tells you when you’re going to do it. Time blocking is a simple, flexible and effective way to help you to manage your time better and stay productive on a daily basis.

The purpose of time blocking isn’t to perfectly complete each and every task planned for the day. The purpose is to encourage us to make plans that will help us to take charge of the direction of your lives.

Most importantly, time blocking helps us to take control of our time — which once lost, we can never get back.

Single-tasking—focusing on one task at a time—can make you up to 80% more productive than splitting your attention across multiple task.

[Context switching](https://blog.rescuetime.com/context-switching/) is the enemy of productivity.

> _There are predictable oscillations present in the days of our lives, and in individual and group work, that affect the outcomes we are working toward. We can improve our chances of success in work and life if we simply recognize these oscillations and use them to our advantage_ [When, Daniel Pink](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn1gjO9yw6I)

## Do you value your time highly enough?

Not planning a schedule, committing to too many tasks or events, and dealing with the many life distractions can all lead to wasted time and anxiety about how to get things done.

As a business owner you need to remember you are leading a business, not working in a job. So all aspects of the business must carry equal weight. Don't fall into the trap of doing what you comfortable **doing**, ignoring other important aspects of running a profitable business.

## Color code your brain

Color code your brain by **theming** each day, hour. Time blocking system is when you schedule big blocks of time to make sure you dedicate enough time to complete any given task. You can take time blocking to the next level by assigning a specific color to each major discipline you need to give focus to.

## Deep Work versus Task Managagent versus Fighting Fires

Deep work is best early in the morning up until lunch time. You should do what you can to imerse yourself in a distraction free zone at this time.

::: tip
Unless you are working in Frontdesk Sales, only take inbound calls during the afternoon when your mind is better suited to task driven work.

## Planning

> _Why bother with such a detailed level of planning? My answer is simple: it generates a massive amount of productivity. A 40 hour time-blocked work week, I estimate, produces the same amount of output as a 60+ hour work week pursued without structure_ [Cal Newport](https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2013/12/21/deep-habits-the-importance-of-planning-every-minute-of-your-work-day/)

Take time blocking **seriously**, dedicating ten to twenty minutes every evening to build your schedule for the next day. During this planning process consult your task lists and calendars, as well as my weekly and quarterly planning notes. Your goal is to make sure progress is being made on the right things at the right pace for the relevant deadlines.

## Set up recurring meetings

Schedule regular sales, marketing, and business best practices meetings with fixed agendas. Recurring meetings carve out a slot to talk about important issues that otherwise may not be prioritized properly if there’s no designated time

## Plan your week the week before

Study next week’s calendar **before Monday** rolls around. That way, you won’t step into any time block unprepared.

Frontloading your week with planning activities to ensure you are productive throughout the rest of the week. So if you have four priorities to accomplish next week:

- Schedules time on Friday of the previous week to analyze the tasks and prepare thoughts to tackle them.
- Schedules time to work on them the following week adding notes and any other research that is needed to tackle the task easily.

## Block personal time

Don’t be scared to sync your work and personal calendar. Planning time to exercise, meditate and prepare food etc is essential to to sharpen the saw and this is essential to the success of the business.

## Sync with your other Calendars

Copy the iCal link into your preferred personal calendar

## Create a “bookend template” for your day

Now it’s time to actually start creating your “blocks.” Instead of jumping straight into your workday, however, start with guardrails for your time outside of work.

What’s your morning routine? How will you disconnect from work and make time for friends, family, and hobbies? These tasks are just as, if not more important than what you do during the day.

Here are a few examples of what this might look like.

If you want to make time for meaningful work, you can try this method from founder and academic Kevin Taylor. Each morning, Kevin has a recurring 2-hour block set aside for writing.

## Quick tips from time blocking experts

It’s never easy changing up the way you work. If you want to make the most out of time blocking, follow these tips.

- Place buffers in between tasks. We all have what’s called “Attention residue” after completing a task that can take anywhere from 10-15 minutes to get over. If you assume you can switch gears on the spot, you’re going to end up frustrated and behind schedule.
- Schedule your breaks (not just lunch). We’re not machines. Make sure you set aside time throughout the day for a quick stretch or walk to give your brain (and your eyes) a rest.
- Use the right daily time management strategies to stay on track. Time blocking means sticking to your schedule. Use daily time management strategies like the Pomodoro method or the 2-minute rule to keep you moving through your schedule and hitting your goals.
- Overestimate how long things will take (at least to start). Remember the planning fallacy? Don’t be over-optimistic with your day until you have a solid understanding of what you can get done. Some experts say you should give yourself 2–3X as long as you think a task will take.
- Put in time for downtime, relaxation, and learning. The most productive people pair work with rest. Give yourself the time you need to relax, let loose, and even learn new skills. You don’t have to be 100% productive 100% of the time.
- Tell people what you’re doing. No one is an island. Make sure the people around you understand what you’re working on, when you’re available, and set realistic expectations on communication and collaboration.
- Set an “overflow day” to stop you from feeling overwhelmed. If you’re constantly falling behind on tasks, you’ll want to set aside an overflow day dedicated to getting caught up.
- Revise as needed. No one works well within a rigid system. Try to be as realistic as possible when you set your schedule but be prepared to move things around or throw it out for a day if a crisis unfolds.

## Staff Routines

Review your staff's **bookend routines** to identify opportunities for improvement, for example are there reports they should run daily before leaving for the day.

- What jobs to you expect each employee to complete in a typical week?
- When is the best time to focus on completing those jobs?
- How long should they work on that job?
- What business discipline is the best category for the job?

1. Enter details into [your operations budget](/docs/growth/finances/create-a-cashflow-forecast)
2. Create appropriately named Clinician Appointment Types
3. In the Admin site **Block Out** time for Admin Staff to complete work as per forecast
4. In other Sites **Block Out** time for Clinicians to complete QA routines

## What to work on

The plans are intended to be dynamic.

1. Use Event naming conventions to establish priority
2. As demands of the week require move appointment around
3. Each night check the discipline for the next day and ask yourself the best question you need to resolve to move the needle tomorrow.

## Closing Routine

- write down the most insightful question when closing the day before
- no Inbound Phones Call or Emails before lunchtime
- make important outbound phones calls early as possible
- save task-based work and [meetings](/docs/growth/productivity/effective-meetings) for the afternoon
- have a [close-down routine](/features/workflows/staff-management/how-to-create-operations-checklists/)

## Analysis

Set aside time to close the loops. This is part of the Getting Things Done idea. Open loops are tasks that need to be done but have no specified next step. Time blocking provides the answer to the question: When will I get this done?

1. How much **Fire Fighting** (reactive time) ate into your plans?
2. What needs to be anchored for a particular time? Create Recurring Appointments.
3. Adjust your baseline forecast
4. Make a plan for next week

::: tip
If you have a business coach, time blocking your schedule for next week is a great way to make their advice actionable and extract maximum benefit for your money.

## Sample Plans

> top performers organize their day through time blocks instead of to-do lists

Take time blocking seriously, dedicating ten to twenty minutes every evening to building my schedule for the next day. During this planning process consult your task lists and calendars, as well as my weekly and quarterly planning notes. Your goal is to make sure progress is being made on the right things at the right pace for the relevant deadlines.

- Make Thursdays follow-up days and set aside Fridays for marketing.
- Blast out emails late on Sunday nights so they’re in people’s inboxes first thing Monday morning.
- Mondays are always hectic with follow-ups from the weekend and getting my staff ramped up and ready to go,
- Schedule time for deep thinking, make yourself uncontactable
- Id activities are fixed vs. flexible
- Schedule time away in a new environment for inspiration
- Schedule personal time, make it a priority to eat well and exercise
- Tune your schedule for your body type
- Delegate

Before ending the day, review for your plan for tomorrow and ask the most insightful question you can, then leave it to your subconscious to process.

::: tip
If you spend a good amount of time each day answering calls, texts, and emails, set aside a certain time each day for these tasks. Communicate these “office hours” on your voicemail message and in your email signature. Your clients and co-workers will appreciate knowing when you’ll respond. They won’t have to guess how busy your day is and when you’ll finally get around to answering your messages.
:::

If you are a business leader you are not just wasting your time, but that of your employees and loved one that have direct impact of the consequences of you not correctly prioritising the most value action you can take at the appropriate time.
