# Your medical practice's secret to success - the essentials of a profitable business strategy

Before you pay your expenses, take your profit first. Run your business based on what you can afford to do today, not what you hope to be able to afford someday. When profit comes first, it is the focus, and it is never forgotten.

## Goal

> Plans are of little importance, but planning is essential - Winston Churchill

The true value of your forecast is not just the numbers but the critical thinking in considering how to negotiate obstacles on the path to achieving your goals.

As you evolve better business habits based on performance analysis so to will your ability to predict the future profits related to plans for expansion.

- How many patients will visit your practice per week?
- What is your fee per consultation?
- What’s your desired weekly income?
- Your number of referrers and referrals per month?
- How many clinicians vs support staff do you need?

## Approach

Improve your [excel skills](https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/excel2016/) if needed.

1. Replace items in the {brackets} with people in your organisation
2. Change the Currency format as required

If you are planning to employ new staff, use placeholder names such as _New Graduate Physio_ until the recruitment hole has been fulfilled.

::: tip
To add a new employee copy all relevant rows of another employee and then [insert paste](https://www.exceltip.com/excel-editing/inserting-a-copied-cells-without-overwriting-existing-data.html) then adjust as required.

## Pricing

A key assumption is that your service price list will be reviewed quarterly.

Replace the names of services, with the actual services and prices you offer and those of your competition for the sake of quarterly comparison and update.

These numbers do not automatically feed into other sheets in this workbook. But you will need to reference this sheet when estimating the maximum hourly rate of each clinician could earn, assuming 100% (Saturation) time is spent with a paying client.

## Scheduled Hours

For each clinician replace the starting values {clinician one} then month by month enter the expected. If you intend to recruit add ghost profiles based on their role.

- scheduled hours
- admin (in-service) hours
- leave hours
- worst and best case saturation expectations, based on demand
  - experience
  - expertise
  - specialisation
  - network

## Cashflow

Start with expenditure as this is easiest. Potential revenue is more subjective and dependent on your strategic goal are driven by greater efficiency or growth.

When estimating sales revenue, consider the Worst case scenario first as a [fear setting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7EVMjgsSME) exercise to help reduce the anxiety that is preventing decisive action.

For revenue Clinician's name as you did in Scheduled Hours, but repeat an entry for each important revenue channel you are interested in for evaluating worst and best case revenue is to ensure each clinician has a total adding up to 100%.

Think of different services/pricing bands that each clinician provides treatment for, then create a line in the sales section for each service type and pricing band.

Steps

1. Match Clinicians in Schedule
2. Create worst and best-case scenarios for what percentage of time each clinician spends performing each service. As an example you would want to limit the percentage of time an Clinician of 20 years spends performing low priced insurance work.
3. Enter the worst and best case ratio and an averaged hourly rate based on the quarter

_GPM service will automatically be calculated based on the total providers scheduled hours._

## Clinical Expertise

Review quarterly to help understand where training gaps are in your practice's quality of service

## Operations

1. Create a breakdown of Jobs by Business Operations that your admin team perform
2. For each job and staff member **Blockout Time** for a month
3. Enter best and worst case hourly rates when 100% booked with clients
4. Enter best and worst case hourly rates for outsource this work.

Most relevant where the businesses is driving the owner rather than the other way round. Specifically where an owner is wearing too many hats rather than outsourcing work to people that don't cost as much and often will have better skills to complete the required job.

The key to outsourcing success is knowing what to expect and how to enforce accountability for outsourced work.

- What is the Opportunity cost of not delegating work effectively?
- Where are the knowledge gaps in your business admin team?

## Strategic Questions

Review for what you want out of transitioning to another software solution and as part of a quarterly management review, judge progress and set strategy for the next quarter.

## Property

Easy proximity to your primary customer profile is essential, but at what cost?

- Are you getting value for money?
- Is your location handy to your target customers?
- Do you have a property manager you trust?

## Benchmark Wages

Refer to this sheet when estimating the cost of employing new staff to cover specific roles

## History

Extract from your Practice Management system.
