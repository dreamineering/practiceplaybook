# Growth by Acquisition

Accumulate talented service providers or under-performing assets.

In fractured allied health markets, GPM has enabled progressive clinics with the ability to fine-tune their operational intelligence and branding to grow organically or by acquisition.

If properly executed, we have seen practices use this strategy to grow their businesses {number} fold and greater in under {number} years

The dynamics for growth through acquisitions is very compelling and include:

- With the increasing numbers of private companies coming up for sale, pricing and deal structuring can be advantageous to the buyer.
- Access to capital – from banks, subordinated debt providers, and private equity – is much easier if you are seen as a capable, rapid growth company.
- Word often gets out in the market that you are an “acquirer” and retiring entrepreneurs will often seek you out to help with their liquidity.
- Top talent is easier to attract.
- The synergies – both in cross-selling and cost savings – can have a huge impact on your profits.

While the potential gains from this strategy are enormous, the risks are very real. Studies of public companies’ acquisitions have shown that the majority of acquisitions don’t add to shareholder value.

And given the relatively limited resources available to most private companies, these risks can be even more dangerous.

## Risks

Some of the biggest mistakes we see with companies who decide to grow through acquisitions include:

1. Chasing deals & taking your eyes off your business
2. Getting Deal Fever – not listening to your due diligence
3. Paying too much cash upfront & taking on too much bank debt
4. Not properly evaluating the soft points
5. Failing to have an integration plan & ignoring the importance of the first 100 days
6. Not taking the tough decisions
7. You can’t delegate
8. Failing to upgrade your talent pool
9. Overestimating the synergies
10. Going after the next deal too quickly
