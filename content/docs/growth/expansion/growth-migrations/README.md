# Gensolve to Gensolve Migrations

We've helped many practices to leverage having a centralised administration team to realise the benefits of economies of scale.

Compared to the headaches that come with most business mergers, the beautiful thing with a _G2G migration_ is that from one day to the next your operations remain the same, leaving your team free to focus on customer service not boring administration tasks.

## Agreement Types

1. Takeover
2. Franchise
3. Merger
4. Breakout

### Takeover

Company A absorbs operations and gains talent from Company B

- Company B closes operations

### Frannchise

Business smarts shared at an organisation level but a separate trading entity is created.

Franchisor **Company A** agrees to bring in **Company B**

- A new Organisation Vendor is created
- Data is migrated into the new Vendor
- Company B is closed

### Merger

Company A, B and C decide to create a new brand and trading (accounting) entity.

- A new organisation is created data is merged
- Companies A, B and C are closed down

### Breakout

Clinicians from an existing Gensolve organisation have an agreement they can take their patient list into a new trading organisation.

## Migration Types

Gensolve to Gensolve migrations are very comprehensive, bringing in practices from other systems has other complexities to resolve but the process is still very smooth.

## Post Merger Checklist

Not everything can be fully migrated or fully automated. So we will provide you a priority checklist of manual tasks to complete the merger to prevent potential losses.
