# Vision and Mission

Take inspiration from the [Crusaders Rugby Team](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMmOOzn9R-k&t=10s)

Strategists should analyze the competitive landscape and markets to determine where the opportunity for the business lies, and how they will access that opportunity.

## Communication

Learn to communicate effectively to insiders and outsiders
People can't work for you if they don't know what you expect, and the message has to be updated daily.

Customers and partners won't find you or buy from you if you can't tell them why, how, and what they need, and what you offer.

Communication must be proactive, not reactive.

## Urgency

Demonstrate an ongoing sense of urgency
In today's world, the market evolves even faster than the technology. Time is of the essence in everything you do.
The business race is not a sprint - there is no finish line, beyond which your team can relax and enjoy. Learn and incent your team to enjoy the journey as well as the destination.

## Accountability

Manage the business with metrics and goals
Working hard is necessary, but not sufficient for success. Business objectives need to be quantified and measured to assess progress and positioning against competition.

Metrics drive a results-oriented culture that leads to continuous quality improvements, required pivots, and recognition of success.

## Mental toughness

Cultivate mental toughness and resilience
Every business encounters unanticipated obstacles due to economic conditions, natural disasters, and competitor challenges, so start practicing resilience early.

One of the most common reasons I see for startup failure is that the entrepreneur gives up too early, rather than fight through these challenges.

I have no doubt that starting and growing a business is hard, at least as difficult as developing an innovative solution.

The difference is that developing a new solution typically requires specialized skills, creative thinking, and strong passion, while starting a business is more about planning, disciplined actions, and problem solving.

Don't lose the race halfway to the finish line.
