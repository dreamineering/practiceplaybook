# Growth

Not just financially but as humans. If you can't achieve consistency across your team, measuring the impact of your strategic initiatives is guesswork. Grow your organisation's [operational intelligence](/docs/workflows/) to share knowledge efficiently and ensure consistent accountable workflows are adhered to.

## First principles to growth

1. Become exceptional at something people will pay good money for
2. Master selling that thing face to face
3. Teach someone else how to master selling your service
4. Quantify success and failure metrics
5. Teach someone else to do what you do
6. Learn how to distribute success stories
7. Set up automated systems to train new employees
8. Manage staff based on measured expectations
9. Add new service channels people will pay good money for
10. Scale

## Direction

## Finance

Every business must put [Profits First](/docs/growth/finances/create-a-cashflow-forecast) as money is the blood that keeps your business alive. A business owner must know how healthy their financial operations are. This requires a realistic prediction of cash flow, even though it can be difficult to forecast the future.

## Quality

Be so good at something that you become a [lynchpin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXlohYo-xPE) to people's needs, then teach others to serve that role even better. Finally, mentor them to teach others.
