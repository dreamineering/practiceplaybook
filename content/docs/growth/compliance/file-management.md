# File Management

**Where did I put that file again?** was it Google Drive, Dropbox, or on the computer at home, wasn't Dave working on that last? **Save time** and confusion by knowing where to find files no matter who last worked on them.

Files in GPM are saved their owners where you control access to who can see confidential information.

Additionally, you can edit word documents and excel workbooks and save directly in the application with messing around with downloading and then re-uploading.

- Do you know where all the master files are that are used to run your organisation?
- Who is responsible for maintaining them?
- Who of your client's have received these files?
- How do you control who can see sensitive information?
- Quickly send files to external people that need them.
