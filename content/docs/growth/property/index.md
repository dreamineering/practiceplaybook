# Property

Setting up a new practice represents a significant financial investment. It will probably cost you a lot of money to get everything to the facility and ensure that the equipment you'll be using is set up correctly. This is a decision that is hard to undo, and therefore, it is important to choose the right property on your first attempt.

There are various factors to think about when you're choosing a medical facility property. How can you ensure the location you pick is just what you need?

## Consider the Distance from the Competition

Even if an area can use another practice, setting up too close to existing practices is not a good idea. Unless patients are extremely dissatisfied with the service they're getting at the other practice, you may struggle to get customers for some time. Try and find a property that's not too close to the existing medical practices in the area.

## Ensure Patients Can Get to the Property Easily

A building far from the center of town may have everything that you need and may even be charging a very favorable amount. However, it's important for your patients to be able to reach your practice easily. A drive that takes them very far from their regular routes is something most patients won't consider.

## The Property Should Be Visible

It's also important for patients to be able to see your practice easily. Marketing a new medical practice can be difficult. Choosing a property that potential patients will be able to see without much effort is a great idea. If you choose a property in an area that's not near a major road, for instance, you'll need to spend more on advertising to let people know where your practice is.

## Choose an Easily Accessible Property

Accessibility is important in a medical facility since some patients may come in on stretchers or wheelchairs. Assess any potential properties and check how accessible it is for the less abled. You can also ask the owner if they have plans to add certain features.

## Physical Appearance Matters

A medical practice is something associated with good health and patients want to see that reflected in the building's exterior and interior appearance. An old building with peeling paint, staining, and other such features will make many patients question the quality of your practice. Patients want a building that looks clean and modern. Good lighting is also important.
