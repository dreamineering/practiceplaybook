# Technology

This involves not only equipment needed to operate the business, but such concerns as communications technology for marketing and sales purposes, or transportation requirements. Understand your needs and balance them with budget demands. Also, the planner may have to be creative when managing technology and equipment. For example, some equipment may be expensive and sit idle most of the time. The planner should then consider renting it as needed, or subcontracting that aspect of production to another company that has that equipment.
