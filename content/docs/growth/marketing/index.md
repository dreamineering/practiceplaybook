# Marketing

Since marketing and sales will generate revenue, you need to understand your target customers and determine how you will reach them. Most practices use an "**inside-out** approach to marketing in that they list their services based on skills and then look to sell to a vaguely defined group that is **out there**.

The **build it and they will come** approach usually results in wasted effort and failure. Assess the needs of your intended client's bearing in mind that upwards of 80% of them are likely to come from within a 10km radius.

## Keep it simple

If upwards of 80% of clients come from within a 10km radius

- What service do people in this zone most need?
- Do you have high traffic nearby?
- Are you easy to stop off at?
- Could you be doing more to encourage this?
- Could you offer more to people in transit?

## Be Genuine

Don't be afraid to show what [genuinely care about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTJyDe7a2bo).

Improving your writing skills is probably one of the best things a business owner can do."_ [Jason Fied](https://drt.fm/jason-fried-2)
