# Content Marketing Calendar

Content creation is the ultimate inbound marketing practice. When you create content, you're providing free and useful information to your audience, attracting potential customers to your website, and retaining existing customers through quality engagement.

## Strategy

**Why Should I Use A Content Calendar?**

The easiest answer is because “winging it” doesn’t work.

If you don’t [have a plan](/docs/growth/productivity/time-blocking/), you’ll end up wasting time you could be spending being productive.

Using a calendar makes it easier to communicate and plan out the right strategy with your marketing consultant. This could mean planning a week, a month, or longer.

You could even plan your content marketing efforts for an entire year, remember that just like creating your profit forecast, plans are fluid and not as valuable as the exercise of thinking ahead to create them.

Once you get your calendar built out, you’ll be able to:

- Hit deadlines more easily and hold yourself accountable for getting stuff done.
- See everything you’re working on in one place
  - Blog posts
  - Social messages
  - Networking Events
  - Email newsletters
  - Text campaigns
  - Podcasts
  - Videos

If you want to leverage your calendar to its fullest though, you’ll plan out as far ahead as you reasonably can. That means allocating space for holidays, seasonal events, and other calendar items you know are going to crop up eventually.

Which content channels are you working with?

- blog or regularly updated website content. This is likely the bread and butter behind your content marketing strategy.
- Social media. Determine which networks you’ll use to promote your content.
- Email. According to Campaign Monitor, it’s 40 times more effective than social media for customer acquisition.
  Podcasts. Don’t know how to start one? We’ll show you.
- Video. Video marketing is growing in importance, and you can use your calendar to plan every shoot.
- Print magazines, brochures, or newsletters. The print world is changing, but it’s not going away anytime soon.
  Anything else you’re working on. If its a marketing project, you can organize it on a calendar.
  Make a list so you can lay it all out.

## Ideation

Have a hopper for catching a backlog of content creation ideas.

1. Schedule time for [brainstorming](https://www.ideou.com/pages/brainstorming)

## Scheduling

- National Holidays
- Commemorative Months

## Production

Schedule time and resources to write content and produce supporting media.

## Distribution

Great content is a waste if your audience doesn’t know it exists so [content distribution](https://www.google.com/search?ei=LTk1XverEbnQmwWY5pKIAg&q=marketing+content+distribution&oq=marketing+content+distribution&gs_l=psy-ab.3..0j0i30l2j0i8i30l6j0i7i5i30.4395.7755..8258...2.2..0.237.1381.8j2j2......0....1..gws-wiz.......0i71j0i7i30j0i13j0i13i5i30j0i8i7i30j0i8i13i30._oBefxLOcDc&ved=0ahUKEwi39sz9-a_nAhU56KYKHRizBCEQ4dUDCAs&uact=5) has to part of your strategy.

## Tools

Tools that will help you ace your content creation ambitions.

- [Hemingway App](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/desktop.html)
- [Buffer](https://buffer.com/)
- [Zapier](https://zapier.com/learn/automate-apps-examples/social-media/)

## GPM

- Color-coding. Every type of content and project can have a consistent color. Blog posts, email newsletters, webinars, social media campaigns, and podcast episodes each have a corresponding color.
- Marketing Campaigns. The color bands at the bottom indicate Marketing Campaigns. This is a feature in CoSchedule that allows you to place multiple related parts of a project or campaign into one folder. Clicking one of these will create a filtered view showing only the items associated with that project.
- Filters. These can be used to filter content on the calendar by type, team member, tag, color label, and more.
