# Find Your Ideal Customer

The ability to find a customer, sell your service, and satisfy the customer so that they buy again should be the central focus of all activity. The greater clarity you have to your ideal customer, the more focused and effective your marketing efforts will be and the greater the alignment of your operations to deliver on your promise.

## Profile

Assess customers along these dimensions

- Perspective
- Capabilities
- Profit potential

### Perspective

Perspective refers to the culture and mission of the business and revealed in stories of the company’s history. Use this lens when considering opportunities and strategic direction. The choice of primary customer must reflect a company’s **perspective** otherwise the company will be unable to leverage the energy and creativity of its people to deliver customer value.

### Capabilities

Capabilities refers to the resources of the firm, which are built up over time and are often difficult to copy to serve the needs of certain customers better than others.

Customers often don’t know exactly what it is they value. Uncovering the full truth about their needs requires systematic research at multiple levels.

### Profit Potential

Profit potential refers to a customer’s ability to deliver profits. Profit potential isn’t always about customers who can pay premium prices; becoming the preferred destination for cost-conscious customers can deliver substantial profits through volume.

## Understand what your Primary Customer Values

Identify which product and service attributes the customer values. To complicate this, customers often don’t know what they value. Set up processes for identifying products or services that customers may not know they need.

Most companies assume that their services meet the needs of their customers. But few test this assumption. Ask how you truly understand what your customers value. Then what can we do to deliver greater value than our competitors?

## Organisation Resources

Does your organisation have the right structures in place to fit your choice of primary customer? If the answer is no, competitors will almost certainly outplay you.

## Measure what Matters and Adapt

If you are single service business e.g physio then **Completed Treatment Plans** and **Client Referrals** but if you have built a customer journey comprised of multiple phases and service to create a virtuous cycle then **Average Revenue per Client** should be added to your focus.

Customer behaviours and needs will alter over time. Constantly be in the routine of asking, What has changed? Why have things changed? What needs to be done about it?

## Document the ideal Client Journey in GPM

Create some dummy persona profiles.

Last Name: Persona
First Name: Target Male

and

Last Name: Persona
First Name: Target Female

Then enter the demographics, make up the ideal treatment journey and then use this a reference point for future training of both clinicians and adminstration staff. _Just be sure to make any appointment charges equal to zero_

Create as many persona profiles as make sense, for example _Insurance convert_.
