# Intelligent Pricing

What science did you apply when setting the hours and prices you are available to your clients? The chances are that while you are working 9 to 5 so are many of your potential customers. Wouldn't it make sense to be available when demand for services is at a peak? charging a higher rate?

- Which people are most likely to [pay top dollar](/docs/growth/marketing/find-your-ideal-customer) for your services?
- When is it most convenient for them to see you?
- What could you do to make it easier to connect with these customers?

Should a person with 20+ years of experience be charging the same rate for services as a recent graduate?

## Anchoring

Give your customer's a frame of reference to help them understand the value of returning to complete a full course of treatment.

- Create a tiered pricing strategy
- Online booking should be for initial appointments
- Consider creating charges by injury type.

| Appointment        | Cost         |
| ------------------ | ------------ |
| Calendar Booking   | Higher       |
| 6 Treatments       | Discounted   |
| 10 Treatments      | Discounted++ |
| Speciality Pathway | Contract     |

It is easier to [sell more to an existing customer](https://hbr.org/2012/07/to-sell-more-focus-on-existing) therefore you can afford to discount for return visits. If you get your customer to pay upfront for a membership then you also save time with cash management and the need to write off potential bad debts.

If you employ front desk staff and have customers making followup bookings something is wrong in your sales and marketing processes.

## Speciality Pathway

For example **Back to Golf** or **Running Performance**

- Who in your area has time and money for extended treatment?
- What do they desire?
- What do they lack?
- What do they have in common?
- How can you do more for them?
- How can you prove that value?
- What triggers a customer to book with you?
