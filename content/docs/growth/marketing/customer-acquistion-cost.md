# Cost of Acquisition

CAC specifically measures the cost to acquire a customer.

CAC = (Marketing Exp + Sales Exp)/(New Customers - Client Referrals)

Paid marketing remains an integral part of many products’ acquisition channels, and one of the key metrics is Customer Acquisition Cost.

This could be actual costs like buying google ads or sponsoring a local competition or the hours spent on creating marketing material to post to Facebook, Instagram, Twitter etc.

The benefit is that when setting referral source for new Clients or Conditions you will begin to understand your business Cost of acquisition and the efficacy of your marketing strategy.

But nothing is going to be more valuable than Clients that referrer other new clients as ultimate proof that your business provides a quality service. To enhance this you could offer clients and staff members incentives (manageable through GPM’s commissions)

To manage this

When using time block out the time explicitly in your calendar.
Add the cost as specific ledger item in your expenses

Note
Appt Type aka Business Function => Marketing
Description aka Activity => The Referral Source you worked to enhance
