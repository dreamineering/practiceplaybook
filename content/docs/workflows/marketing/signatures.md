## Add Custom Graphics to your Headers and Footers

Your company logo can be uploaded to GPM and displayed on the splash screen (when GPM is opened) and on the invoice header (used on printed invoices).

The graphics should be in the ".png" format with dimensions 344 by 88 pixels for the splash screen and 700 by 124 pixels for the invoice header.

However, there is also an Auto Resize feature that attempts to format the image to the correct dimensions.

At a Vendor (Global) or Site level you can customise the graphics for:

- Invoice/Receipt Header
- Receipt Footer
- Invoice Footer
- Discharge Report Header

## How to set correct Invoice or Receipt contact details for the business

In GPM, Vendor Name and Site Name usually represents a physical location.

You can specify a Vendor or Site Trading Name for accounting purposes (receipts and invoices) if the trading name differs from the name of the physical location.
