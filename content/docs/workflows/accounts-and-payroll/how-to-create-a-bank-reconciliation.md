This report shows transactions that have been included in a bank reconciliation. It can be run between certain dates, particular sites, bank accounts, and can be grouped in different ways based on bank account and site.

It is used to search for transactions that have been included in a bank reconciliation, for investigative purposes, without having to go into multiple past bank reconciliations.
