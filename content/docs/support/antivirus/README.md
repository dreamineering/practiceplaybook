Please note the guidance below is only on how you can install Gensolve Practice Manager and not security advice, if you have any doubts about your setup, please refer to a security expert.

Many businesses that use GPM rely only on Windows 10's Defender security center and we ensure GPM functions correctly with each Windows 10 security update. But we do not keep up with changes to all antivirus options.

As a general principle, antivirus software needs to be configured with rules that allow Gensolve to be installed and access the internet and to preserve these rules when antivirus software updates occur.

If you are sure you need to have Antivirus software, but are unsure of how to configure the antivirus software to allow GPM to be installed then you will need to speak with third party security expert.
