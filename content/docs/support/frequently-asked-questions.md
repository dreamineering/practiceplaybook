## How do I email a report to a Clinician?

**Don't!** It is more effective to create a recurring event that reminds clinicians of important tasks to complete. If you find a Clinician is ignoring the reminder, you can choose to set the **pop up reminder** or for repeat offenders create an official **WARNING** event to remind them of run their reports.

The advantage of doing this over email is that as a manager you can run this report again during an in-service performance review.
